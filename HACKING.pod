=head1 Getting Setup

First, you need Module::Build

  cpan Module::Build

Then create the Build script

  perl Build.PL

If you are missing dependencies, it will complain.  Use CPAN to add them
and/or see the svn section below.

Once all of the Wx, etc is setup, you can Build:

  ./Build

For more options:

  ./Build help

Test it (or use the C<./Build testall> target)

  ./Build test
  ./Build testgui

And to run it:

  ./Build run

Or

  ./run

=head1 Patches

Release tarballs can quickly become stale.  For best results, work with
a checkout of the subversion repository.  See below.

=head1 SVN

The most current development is always in:

  http://svn.dotreader.com/svn/dotreader/trunk/

The directory tree should be roughly:

  svn/ ................. open repository root
  |-- dotreader/ ....... main dotreader development
  |   |-- trunk/ ....... latest (Build.PL, t, lib, ...)
  |   |-- tags/* ....... tagged versions (of trunk)
  |   `-- branches/* ... experimental forks
  |-- testing/ ......... misc experiments
  `-- content/ ......... ? versioned test content

For patches and updates to the dependencies, see

  http://svn.dotreader.com/deps

There you will find some directories defined with svn:externals.  These
allow you to checkout all of the latest dependency code into just a few
working copies and makes it more convenient for us to add or change
dependencies.

=head1 Directory Layout

  ./ ................. archive or working-copy root (e.g. trunk)
  |-- client/ ........ wx gui code
  |-- inc/ ........... Build utilities (some testing junk too)
  |-- lib/ ........... core modules
  |-- prototype/ ..... experiments
  |-- t/ ............. tests
  |   |-- _gui/ ...... gui tests
  |   |-- _sync/ ..... client/server tests
  |   `-- */ ......... various categorized tests
  |-- test_data/ ..... test input
  |-- test_inc/ ...... test utility modules (hacks)
  |-- test_packages/ . test books
  |-- test_lib/ ...... test-specific modules (more formalized)
  `-- util/ .......... command-line demo and utilities
