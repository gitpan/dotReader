About Thout Thout (pronounced \"th-out\") was the ancient Egyptian God of Knowledge symbolized by the Ibis. OSoft's Thout logo depicts an ibis with chaos and confusion of binary information on one side and logic, order, and knowledge on the other. Trivia: The binary code to the right of the ibis spells K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E.

Note: We are actively seeking authors and developers who would like to publish their content on OSoft.com via the ThoutReaderTM.

3: "PACKAGE MANAGEMENT A package is defined as a collection of content that has been prepared for viewing with the ThoutReaderTM. For example, this Quick Start Guide is a package, as is any referenceware, book, or other content that can be viewed by the ThoutReaderTM. Download New Packages Additional packages that can be read by the ThoutReaderTM can be downloaded several ways: Go to www.osoft.com or other content provider and download directly from that site. Click the Download Icon from the Quick Navigation Buttons in the upper right menu as shown below. This will take you directly to OSoft's content repository. Create and install your own packages created from ThoutCreator&#8482; tools. Many packages at www.osoft.com are free. These include all of the available open source application documentation. Top selling reference books and author contributed content are available for a reasonable price. Re-downloading Packages All packages, both commercial and free, may be re-downloaded from your OSoft user account at www.osoft.com. This is particularly useful if the original download was interrupted or if you choose to install your content on more than one computer owned and used by you. To do this: Log-in to your OSoft.com user account. Select Download Products...Previous Downloads...Select file(s) to re-download. Installing Packages IMPORTANT: In order to be visible by the ThoutReaderTM, packages must be installed through the ThoutReader&#8482; File Menu. &#160; To install a Thout Reader package:: From the Menu bar, Select File...Add Package Navigate to your downloaded or created package.

Removing Packages Removing a package from the ThoutReader&#8482; does not delete the package from your computer, it only removes it from the ThoutReader&#8482; library. To remove a package from the ThoutReader&#8482; library: Select the Library Tab Right-click the package you wish to remove...select Remove Package Reader Registration Key The ThoutReader&#8482; has the ability to read encrypted commercial packages. The encryption is based on the user, not the hardware the package is installed on. This means that you can install your content on any number of platforms/computers you own and use without restriction. Simply re-download the content and install your Reader Registration Key into your other machines. Encryption is entirely contained within the package itself and is designed to be minimally invasive. You only need to install the registration key once per machine. After that, you can download additional commercial content from that provider without any further action. There are no ongoing log-ins, passwords, or other requirements. Note: The ThoutReader&#8482; Key is only required if you purchase commercial, encrypted content. No action is required for the download and use of free content. Note: If you receive the following error message, it means that the Reader Registration Key is not installed for that package. To add your ThoutReader&#8482; key, do the following: Log in to your OSoft User Account Select Download Reader Registration Key and download your key to your computer desktop Open the ThoutReader Select File...Add Key...Navigate to your OSOFT.KEY file...Install the key You will receive a confirmation that the key was successfully installed. You can delete the key file on your desktop. &#160; Note: You can store multiple Reader Registration Keys into the ThoutReader&#8482;. For example, each publisher that distributes content directly will generate their own User Registration Key. You need only install that key one time. View a Package The ThoutReaderTM comes with one pre-installed package, this Quick Start Guide. By default, the Quick Start Guide will automatically be displayed in the Content Window the first time you open the ThoutReaderTM. The ThoutReaderTM browse view will display your last viewed package the next time you load the ThoutReaderTM. To View an index of all installed packages, click the Library Tab.

To create a folder/sub-folder, select the root you want the folder to be displayed in and right click anywhere in the Library pane...select Add Folder Drag and drop selected contents into the desired folder. TIP : Organizing your library will speed searches by allowing you to quickly designate which file folder(s) of content to search in Advanced Search.
