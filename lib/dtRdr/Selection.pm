sub set_selected {
  my $self = shift;
  my ($string) = @_;
  my @selected;
  if(length($string) > limit) {
    $selected[0] = substr($string, 0, limit/2);
    $selected[1] = substr($string, -(limit/2));
  }
  else {
    $selected[0] = $string;
  }
  $self->SUPER::set_selected(\@selected);
} # end subroutine set_selected definition

=head2 get_selected_string

Handles the issue of whether the selection is one or two pieces.

  my $string = $selection->get_selected_string;

Returns one of the following:

  undef       -- there is no 'selected' value
  "foo...bar" -- two pieces
  "foo"       -- a one-piece (short) selection

=cut

sub get_selected_string {
  my $self = shift;
  my $selected = $self->selected;
  $selected or return;
  return(join('...', @$selected)) if(defined($selected->[1]));
  return($selected->[0]);
} # end subroutine get_selected_string definition
